## Problem

You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n`, where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i^{th}` block in an exercise routine.

You start on the ground (height 0) and **must** jump onto each block **exactly once** in any order.

	- The **calories burned** for a jump from a block of height `a` to a block of height `b` is `(a - b)^{2}`.

	- The **calories burned** for the first jump from the ground to the chosen first block `heights[i]` is `(0 - heights[i])^{2}`.

Return the **maximum** total calories you can burn by selecting an optimal jumping sequence.

**Note:** Once you jump onto the first block, you cannot return to the ground.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** heights = [1,7,9]

**Output:** 181

**Explanation:**​​​​​​​

The optimal sequence is `[9, 1, 7]`.

	- Initial jump from the ground to `heights[2] = 9`: `(0 - 9)^{2} = 81`.

	- Next jump to `heights[0] = 1`: `(9 - 1)^{2} = 64`.

	- Final jump to `heights[1] = 7`: `(1 - 7)^{2} = 36`.

Total calories burned = `81 + 64 + 36 = 181`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** heights = [5,2,4]

**Output:** 38

**Explanation:**

The optimal sequence is `[5, 2, 4]`.

	- Initial jump from the ground to `heights[0] = 5`: `(0 - 5)^{2} = 25`.

	- Next jump to `heights[1] = 2`: `(5 - 2)^{2} = 9`.

	- Final jump to `heights[2] = 4`: `(2 - 4)^{2} = 4`.

Total calories burned = `25 + 9 + 4 = 38`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** heights = [3,3]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

The optimal sequence is `[3, 3]`.

	- Initial jump from the ground to `heights[0] = 3`: `(0 - 3)^{2} = 9`.

	- Next jump to `heights[1] = 3`: `(3 - 3)^{2} = 0`.

Total calories burned = `9 + 0 = 9`.



**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == heights.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^{5}`

### Hints

1. Sort `heights` and greedily distribute the values.
2. Place larger values from the back of the sorted `heights` in non-increasing order at the even indices.
3. Place smaller values from the front of the sorted `heights` in non-decreasing order at the odd indices.
