# 0814. Binary Tree Pruning

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/)
- **Tags:** tree, depth-first-search, binary-tree

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a *`1`* has been removed*.

A subtree of a node `node` is `node` plus every node that is a descendant of `node`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** root = [1,null,0,0,1]
**Output:** [1,null,0,null,1]
**Explanation:**
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** root = [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
**Output:** [1,null,1,null,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** root = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
**Output:** [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 200]`.

	- `Node.val` is either `0` or `1`.
