- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-empty/](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-empty/)
- **Tags:** array, binary-search, greedy, binary-indexed-tree, segment-tree, sorting, ordered-set

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` containing **distinct** numbers, and you can perform the following operations **until the array is empty**:

- If the first element has the **smallest** value, remove it

	- Otherwise, put the first element at the **end** of the array.

Return *an integer denoting the number of operations it takes to make *`nums`* empty.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,4,-1]
**Output:** 5
```



			Operation
			Array




			1
			[4, -1, 3]


			2
			[-1, 3, 4]


			3
			[3, 4]


			4
			[4]


			5
			[]



**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,4,3]
**Output:** 5
```



			Operation
			Array




			1
			[2, 4, 3]


			2
			[4, 3]


			3
			[3, 4]


			4
			[4]


			5
			[]



**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 3
```



			Operation
			Array




			1
			[2, 3]


			2
			[3]


			3
			[]



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `-10^{9 }<= nums[i] <= 10^{9}`

	- All values in `nums` are **distinct**.

### Hints

1. Understand the order in which the indices are removed from the array.
2. We don’t really need to delete or move the elements, only the array length matters.
3. Upon removing an index, decide how many steps it takes to move to the next one.
4. Use a data structure to speed up the calculation.
