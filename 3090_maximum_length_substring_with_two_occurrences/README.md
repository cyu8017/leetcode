## Problem

Given a string `s`, return the **maximum** length of a substring such that it contains *at most two occurrences* of each character.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "bcbbbcba"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"bcbbbcba"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaaa"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"aaaa"`.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 100`

	- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Hints

1. We can try all substrings by brute-force since the constraints are very small.
