- **Tags:** string, greedy

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Define a function `distance(s_{1}, s_{2})` between two strings `s_{1}` and `s_{2}` of the same length `n` as:

- The** sum** of the **minimum distance** between `s_{1}[i]` and `s_{2}[i]` when the characters from `'a'` to `'z'` are placed in a **cyclic** order, for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

For example, `distance("ab", "cd") == 4`, and `distance("a", "z") == 1`.

You can **change** any letter of `s` to **any** other lowercase English letter, **any** number of times.

Return a string denoting the **lexicographically smallest** string `t` you can get after some changes, such that `distance(s, t) <= k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "zbbz", k = 3

**Output:** "aaaz"

**Explanation:**

Change `s` to `"aaaz"`. The distance between `"zbbz"` and `"aaaz"` is equal to `k = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "xaxcd", k = 4

**Output:** "aawcd"

**Explanation:**

The distance between "xaxcd" and "aawcd" is equal to k = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "lol", k = 0

**Output:** "lol"

**Explanation:**

It's impossible to change any character as `k = 0`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`

	- `0 <= k <= 2000`

	- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Hints

1. The problem can be approached greedily.
2. For each index in order from `0` to `n - 1`, we try all letters from `'a'` to `'z'`, selecting the first one as long as the current total distance accumulated is not larger than `k`.
