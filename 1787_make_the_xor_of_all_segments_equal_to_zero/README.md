## Problem

You are given an array `nums`​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​. The XOR of a segment `[left, right]` where `left <= right` is the `XOR` of all the elements with indices between `left` and `right`, inclusive: `nums[left] XOR nums[left+1] XOR ... XOR nums[right]`.

Return *the minimum number of elements to change in the array *such that the `XOR` of all segments of size `k`​​​​​​ is equal to zero.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,0,3,0], k = 1
**Output:** 3
**Explanation: **Modify the array from [**1**,**2**,0,**3**,0] to from [**0**,**0**,0,**0**,0].
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,2,1,7,3,4,7], k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation: **Modify the array from [3,4,**5**,**2**,**1**,7,3,4,7] to [3,4,**7**,**3**,**4**,7,3,4,7].
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,4,1,2,5,1,2,6], k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation: **Modify the array from [1,2,**4,**1,2,**5**,1,2,**6**] to [1,2,**3**,1,2,**3**,1,2,**3**].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 2000`

	- `​​​​​​0 <= nums[i] < 2^{10}`

### Hints

1. Let's note that for the XOR of all segments with size K to be equal to zeros, nums[i] has to be equal to nums[i+k]
2. Basically, we need to make the first K elements have XOR = 0 and then modify them.
