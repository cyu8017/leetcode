## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list containing `k` **distinct** elements, return *the head to a linked list of length *`k`* containing the frequency of each **distinct** element in the given linked list in **any order**.*



**Example 1: **

**Input: **  head = [1,1,2,1,2,3]

**Output: **  [3,2,1]

**Explanation: ** There are `3` distinct elements in the list. The frequency of `1` is `3`, the frequency of `2` is `2` and the frequency of `3` is `1`. Hence, we return `3 -> 2 -> 1`.

Note that `1 -> 2 -> 3`, `1 -> 3 -> 2`, `2 -> 1 -> 3`, `2 -> 3 -> 1`, and `3 -> 1 -> 2` are also valid answers.

**Example 2: **

**Input: **  head = [1,1,2,2,2]

**Output: **  [2,3]

**Explanation: ** There are `2` distinct elements in the list. The frequency of `1` is `2` and the frequency of `2` is `3`. Hence, we return `2 -> 3`.

**Example 3: **

**Input: **  head = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

**Output: **  [1,1,1,1,1,1]

**Explanation: ** There are `6` distinct elements in the list. The frequency of each of them is `1`. Hence, we return `1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1`.



**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^{5}]`.

	- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^{5}`
