## Problem

Given two integers `n` and `k`, split the number `n` into exactly `k` positive integers such that the **product** of these integers is equal to `n`.

Return *any* *one* split in which the **maximum** difference between any two numbers is **minimized**. You may return the result in *any order*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 100, k = 2

**Output:** [10,10]

**Explanation:**

The split `[10, 10]` yields `10 * 10 = 100` and a max-min difference of 0, which is minimal.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 44, k = 3

**Output:** [2,2,11]

**Explanation:**

Split `[1, 1, 44]` yields a difference of 43

	Split `[1, 2, 22]` yields a difference of 21

	Split `[1, 4, 11]` yields a difference of 10

	Split `[2, 2, 11]` yields a difference of 9

Therefore, `[2, 2, 11]` is the optimal split with the smallest difference 9.

**Constraints:**

	k is strictly less than the total number of positive divisors of n.

### Hints

1. First, compute all positive divisors of `n` and sort them into a list `divs`.
2. Use a recursive search `dfs(start, picked, prod, path)` that picks the next divisor from `divs[start...]`, multiplies it into `prod`, and appends to `path` until you have `k` factors whose product is `n`.
3. During the search, keep track of the best `path` that minimizes max(path) – min(path) and return it.
