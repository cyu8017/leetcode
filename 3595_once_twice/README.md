# 3595. Once Twice

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/once-twice/](https://leetcode.com/problems/once-twice/)
- **Premium:** Yes
- **Tags:** array, bit-manipulation

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. In this array:

	- Exactly one element appears **once**.



	- Exactly one element appears **twice**.



	- All other elements appear **exactly three times**.



Return an integer array of length 2, where the first element is the one that appears **once**, and the second is the one that appears **twice**.

Your solution must run in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,2,5,5,5,7,7]

**Output:** [3,7]

**Explanation:**

The element 3 appears **once**, and the element 7 appears **twice**. The remaining elements each appear **three times**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,4,6,4,9,9,9,6,8]

**Output:** [8,6]

**Explanation:**

The element 8 appears **once**, and the element 6 appears **twice**. The remaining elements each appear **three times**.



**Constraints:**

	- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `-2^{31} <= nums[i] <= 2^{31} - 1`

	- `nums.length` is a multiple of 3.

	- Exactly one element appears once, one element appears twice, and all other elements appear three times.
