- **Tags:** array, matrix, enumeration, prefix-sum

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make **either one horizontal or one vertical cut** on the grid such that:

- Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is **non-empty**.

	- The sum of the elements in both sections is **equal**.

Return `true` if such a partition exists; otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is `true`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is `false`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m == grid.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 10^{5}`

	- `2 <= m * n <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^{5}`

### Hints

1. There are two types of cuts: a `horizontal` cut or a `vertical` cut.
2. For a `horizontal` cut at row `r` (0 <= r <m - 1), split `grid` into rows 0...r vs. r+1...m-1 and compare their sums.
3. For a `vertical` cut at column `c` (0 <= c < n - 1), split `grid` into columns 0...c vs. c+1...n-1 and compare their sums.
4. Brute‑force all possible `r` and `c` cuts; if any yields equal section sums, return `true`.
