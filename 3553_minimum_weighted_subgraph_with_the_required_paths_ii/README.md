## Problem

You are given an **undirected weighted** tree with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. It is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}, w_{i}] indicates that there is an edge between nodes u_{i} and v_{i} with weight w_{i}.​

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array queries, where queries[j] = [src1_{j}, src2_{j}, dest_{j}].

Return an array answer of length equal to queries.length, where answer[j] is the **minimum total weight** of a subtree such that it is possible to reach dest_{j} from both src1_{j} and src2_{j} using edges in this subtree.

A **subtree** here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries = [[2,3,4],[0,2,5]]

**Output:** [12,11]

**Explanation:**

The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer.

	`answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 2` and `src2 = 3` to `dest = 4` is `3 + 5 + 4 = 12`.




	`answer[1]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 2` to `dest = 5` is `2 + 3 + 6 = 11`.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]]

**Output:** [15]

**Explanation:**

- `answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 1` to `dest = 2` is `8 + 7 = 15`.

**Constraints:**

`3 <= n <= 10^{5}`

	`edges.length == n - 1`

	`edges[i].length == 3`

	`0 <= u_{i}, v_{i} < n`

	`1 <= w_{i} <= 10^{4}`

	`1 <= queries.length <= 10^{5}`

	`queries[j].length == 3`

	`0 <= src1_{j}, src2_{j}, dest_{j} < n`

	- `src1_{j}`, `src2_{j}`, and `dest_{j}` are pairwise distinct.

	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

### Hints

1. Binary lifting
2. Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of any two nodes using binary lifting
3. For any node `x`, let `f(x)` be the distance from the root to `x`. Then for two nodes `x` and `y`:`d(x, y) = f(x) + f(y) - 2 * f(LCA(x, y))`
4. For three nodes `a`, `b` and `c`, the minimum total weight of the subtree connecting all three is:`(d(a, b) + d(b, c) + d(c, a)) / 2`, where `d(x, y)` is the distance between nodes `x` and `y`
