## Problem

You are given a 2D array `points` of size `n x 2` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [x_{i}, y_{i}]`.

Count the number of pairs of points `(A, B)`, where

- `A` is on the **upper left** side of `B`, and

	- there are no other points in the rectangle (or line) they make (**including the border**), except for the points `A` and `B`.

Return the count.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There is no way to choose `A` and `B` such that `A` is on the upper left side of `B`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- The left one is the pair `(points[1], points[0])`, where `points[1]` is on the upper left side of `points[0]` and the rectangle is empty.

	- The middle one is the pair `(points[2], points[1])`, same as the left one it is a valid pair.

	- The right one is the pair `(points[2], points[0])`, where `points[2]` is on the upper left side of `points[0]`, but `points[1]` is inside the rectangle so it's not a valid pair.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

- The left one is the pair `(points[2], points[0])`, where `points[2]` is on the upper left side of `points[0]` and there are no other points on the line they form. Note that it is a valid state when the two points form a line.

	- The middle one is the pair `(points[1], points[2])`, it is a valid pair same as the left one.

	- The right one is the pair `(points[1], points[0])`, it is not a valid pair as `points[2]` is on the border of the rectangle.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 50`

	- `points[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 50`

	- All `points[i]` are distinct.

### Hints

1. We can enumerate all the upper-left and lower-right corners.
2. If the upper-left corner is `(x1, y1)` and lower-right corner is `(x2, y2)`, check that there is no point `(x, y)` such that `x1 <= x <= x2` and `y2 <= y <= y1`.
