# 2508. Add Edges to Make Degrees of All Nodes Even

- **Difficulty:** Hard

## Problem

There is an **undirected** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a **2D** array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_{i}, b_{i}]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_{i}` and `b_{i}`. The graph can be disconnected.

You can add **at most** two additional edges (possibly none) to this graph so that there are no repeated edges and no self-loops.

Return `true`* if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph even, otherwise return *`false`*.*

The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,2],[1,4],[2,5]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The above diagram shows a valid way of adding an edge.
Every node in the resulting graph is connected to an even number of edges.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[3,4]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The above diagram shows a valid way of adding two edges.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** It is not possible to obtain a valid graph with adding at most 2 edges.
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n <= 10^{5}`

	- `2 <= edges.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `edges[i].length == 2`

	- `1 <= a_{i}, b_{i} <= n`

	- `a_{i} != b_{i}`

	- There are no repeated edges.

### Hints

1. Notice that each edge that we add changes the degree of exactly 2 nodes.
2. The number of nodes with an odd degree in the original graph should be either 0, 2, or 4. Try to work on each of these cases.
