## Problem

There is a **simple directed graph** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph would form a **tree** if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer `n` and a **2D** integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}]` represents a **directed edge** going from node `u_{i}` to node `v_{i}`.

An **edge reversal** changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node `u_{i}` to node `v_{i}` becomes a directed edge going from node `v_{i}` to node `u_{i}`.

For every node `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, your task is to **independently** calculate the **minimum** number of **edge reversals** required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a **sequence** of **directed edges**.

Return *an integer array *`answer`*, where *`answer[i]`* is the** * **minimum** number of **edge reversals** required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node *`i`* through a **sequence** of **directed edges**.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]
**Output:** [1,1,0,2]
**Explanation:** The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 1.
For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 1.
For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 0.
For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 3.
So, answer[3] = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]]
**Output:** [2,0,1]
**Explanation:** The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 2.
For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 0.
For node 2: after reversing the edge [1, 2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^{5}`

	- `edges.length == n - 1`

	- `edges[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= u_{i} == edges[i][0] < n`

	- `0 <= v_{i} == edges[i][1] < n`

	- `u_{i} != v_{i}`

	- The input is generated such that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would be a tree.

### Hints

1. The problem can be solved using tree DP.
2. Using node `0` as the root, let `dp[x]` be the minimum number of edge reversals so node `x` can reach every node in its subtree.
3. Using a DFS traversing the edges bidirectionally, we can compute `dp`.

`dp[x] = dp[y] +` (`1` if the edge between `x` and `y` is going from `y` to `x`; `0` otherwise), where `x` is the parent of `y`.
4. Let `answer[x]` be the minimum number of edge reversals so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `x`.
5. Using another DFS starting from node `0` and traversing the edges bidirectionally, we can compute `answer`.

`answer[0] = dp[0]`

`answer[y] = answer[x] +` (`1` if the edge between `x` and `y` is going from `x` to `y`; `-1` otherwise), where `x` is the parent of `y`.
