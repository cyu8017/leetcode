## Problem

You are given an undirected connected graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}, w_{i}] denotes an undirected edge between node u_{i} and node v_{i} with weight w_{i}, and an integer k.

You are allowed to remove any number of edges from the graph such that the resulting graph has **at most** k connected components.

The **cost** of a component is defined as the **maximum** edge weight in that component. If a component has no edges, its cost is 0.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** cost among all components **after such removals**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[3,4,6]], k = 2

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Remove the edge between nodes 3 and 4 (weight 6).

	The resulting components have costs of 0 and 4, so the overall maximum cost is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5]], k = 1

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

No edge can be removed, since allowing only one component (`k = 1`) requires the graph to stay fully connected.

	That single component’s cost equals its largest edge weight, which is 5.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^{4}`

	- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `edges[i].length == 3`

	- `0 <= u_{i}, v_{i} < n`

	- `1 <= w_{i} <= 10^{6}`

	- `1 <= k <= n`

	- The input graph is connected.

### Hints

1. Sort the `edges` and do binary search on the candidate maximum weight
2. Use `DFS` or `DSU` to count the number of connected components when keeping only edges with weight <= mid
