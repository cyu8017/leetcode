## Problem

An array `A` is larger than some array `B` if for the first index `i` where `A[i] != B[i]`, `A[i] > B[i]`.

For example, consider `0`-indexing:

	- `[1,3,2,4] > [1,2,2,4]`, since at index `1`, `3 > 2`.

	- `[1,4,4,4] < [2,1,1,1]`, since at index `0`, `1 < 2`.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Given an integer array `nums` of **distinct** integers, return the **largest** subarray of `nums` of length `k`.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,5,2,3], k = 3
**Output:** [5,2,3]
**Explanation:** The subarrays of size 3 are: [1,4,5], [4,5,2], and [5,2,3].
Of these, [5,2,3] is the largest.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,5,2,3], k = 4
**Output:** [4,5,2,3]
**Explanation:** The subarrays of size 4 are: [1,4,5,2], and [4,5,2,3].
Of these, [4,5,2,3] is the largest.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,5,2,3], k = 1
**Output:** [5]



**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^{9}`

	- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.



**Follow up:** What if the integers in `nums` are not distinct?

### Hints

1. Search for the largest integer in the range [0, n - k]
2. This integer is the first element in the subarray. You should take it with the k - 1 elements after it.
