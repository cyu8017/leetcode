- **Difficulty:** Medium

- **Tags:** math, enumeration

## Problem

Given a **non-negative** integer `num`, return `true`* if *`num`* can be expressed as the sum of any **non-negative** integer and its reverse, or *`false`* otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** num = 443
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 172 + 271 = 443 so we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** num = 63
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** 63 cannot be expressed as the sum of a non-negative integer and its reverse so we return false.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** num = 181
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 140 + 041 = 181 so we return true. Note that when a number is reversed, there may be leading zeros.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= num <= 10^{5}`

### Hints

1. The constraints are small enough that we can check every number.
2. To reverse a number, first convert it to a string. Then, create a new string that is the reverse of the first one. Finally, convert the new string back into a number.
