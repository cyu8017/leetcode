## Problem

You are given two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively.

You are also given a 2D integer array `sources`, where `sources[i] = [r_{i}, c_{i}, color_{​​​​​​​i}]` indicates that the cell `(r_{i}, c_{i})` is initially colored with `color_{i}`. All other cells are initially uncolored and represented as 0.

At each time step, every currently colored cell spreads its color to all adjacent **uncolored** cells in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. All spreads happen simultaneously.

If **multiple** colors reach the same uncolored cell at the same time step, the cell takes the color with the **maximum** value.

The process continues until no more cells can be colored.

Return a 2D integer array representing the final state of the grid, where each cell contains its final color.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, m = 3, sources = [[0,0,1],[2,2,2]]

**Output:** [[1,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,2,2]]

**Explanation:**

The grid at each time step is as follows:

​​​​​​​

At time step 2, cells `(0, 2)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(2, 0)` are reached by both colors, so they are assigned color 2 as it has the maximum value among them.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, m = 3, sources = [[0,1,3],[1,1,5]]

**Output:** [[3,3,3],[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]

**Explanation:**

The grid at each time step is as follows:

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 2, sources = [[1,1,5]]

**Output:** [[5,5],[5,5]]

**Explanation:**

The grid at each time step is as follows:

​​​​​​​

Since there is only one source, all cells are assigned the same color.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, m <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= n * m <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= sources.length <= n * m`

	- `sources[i] = [r_{i}, c_{i}, color_{i}]`

	- `0 <= r_{i} <= n - 1`

	- `0 <= c_{i} <= m - 1`

	- `1 <= color_{i} <= 10^{6}​​​​​​​`

	- All `(r_{i}, c_{i}​​​​​​​)` in `sources` are distinct.

### Hints

1. Multi-source BFS
2. Initialize a queue with all colored cells
3. Spread colors level by level to adjacent cells in `4` directions
4. If multiple colors reach the same cell at the same time, assign the maximum color value
