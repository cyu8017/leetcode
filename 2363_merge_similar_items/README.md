- **Tags:** array, hash-table, sorting, ordered-set

## Problem

You are given two 2D integer arrays, `items1` and `items2`, representing two sets of items. Each array `items` has the following properties:

- `items[i] = [value_{i}, weight_{i}]` where `value_{i}` represents the **value** and `weight_{i}` represents the **weight **of the `i^{th}` item.

	- The value of each item in `items` is **unique**.

Return *a 2D integer array* `ret` *where* `ret[i] = [value_{i}, weight_{i}]`*,* *with* `weight_{i}` *being the **sum of weights** of all items with value* `value_{i}`.

**Note:** `ret` should be returned in **ascending** order by value.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]
**Output:** [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
**Explanation:**
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.
The item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.
Therefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** items1 = [[1,1],[3,2],[2,3]], items2 = [[2,1],[3,2],[1,3]]
**Output:** [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]]
**Explanation:**
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 3, total weight = 1 + 3 = 4.
The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 3 + 1 = 4.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4.
Therefore, we return [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]].
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** items1 = [[1,3],[2,2]], items2 = [[7,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
**Output:** [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]]
**Explanation:
**The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 4, total weight = 3 + 4 = 7.
The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4.
The item with value = 7 occurs in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 1.
Therefore, we return [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000`

	- `items1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2`

	- `1 <= value_{i}, weight_{i} <= 1000`

	- Each `value_{i}` in `items1` is **unique**.

	- Each `value_{i}` in `items2` is **unique**.

### Hints

1. Map the weights using the corresponding values as keys.
2. Make sure your output is sorted in ascending order by value.
