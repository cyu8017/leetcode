## Problem

Bob is stuck in a dungeon and must break `n` locks, each requiring some amount of **energy** to break. The required energy for each lock is stored in an array called `strength` where `strength[i]` indicates the energy needed to break the `i^{th}` lock.

To break a lock, Bob uses a sword with the following characteristics:

	- The initial energy of the sword is 0.

	- The initial factor `X` by which the energy of the sword increases is 1.

	- Every minute, the energy of the sword increases by the current factor `X`.

	- To break the `i^{th}` lock, the energy of the sword must reach at least `strength[i]`.

	- After breaking a lock, the energy of the sword resets to 0, and the factor `X` increases by 1.

Your task is to determine the **minimum** time in minutes required for Bob to break all `n` locks and escape the dungeon.

Return the **minimum **time required for Bob to break all `n` locks.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** strength = [3,4,1]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**



			Time
			Energy
			X
			Action
			Updated X


			0
			0
			1
			Nothing
			1


			1
			1
			1
			Break 3^{rd} Lock
			2


			2

			Nothing
			2


			3
			4
			2
			Break 2^{nd} Lock
			3


			4
			3
			3
			Break 1^{st} Lock
			3



The locks cannot be broken in less than 4 minutes; thus, the answer is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strength = [2,5,4]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**



			Time
			Energy
			X
			Action
			Updated X


			0
			0
			1
			Nothing

			Break 3^{rd} Lock
			3


			5

			6
			6
			3
			Break 2^{nd} Lock
			4



The locks cannot be broken in less than 6 minutes; thus, the answer is 6.



**Constraints:**

	- `n == strength.length`

	- `1 <= n <= 80`

	- `1 <= strength[i] <= 10^{6}`
