- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/)

- **Tags:** hash-table, linked-list

## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, find all the values that appear **more than once** in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values.

Return *the linked list after the deletions.*



**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,2]

**Output:** [1,3]

**Explanation:** 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted. After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [2,1,1,2]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** 2 and 1 both appear twice. All the elements should be deleted.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [3,2,2,1,3,2,4]

**Output:** [1,4]

**Explanation: **3 appears twice and 2 appears three times. After deleting all 3's and 2's, we are left with [1,4].



**Constraints:**

    - The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^{5}]`

    - `1 <= Node.val <= 10^{5}`
