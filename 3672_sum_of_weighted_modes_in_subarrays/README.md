## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

For every **subarray** of length `k`:

	- The **mode** is defined as the element with the **highest frequency**. If there are multiple choices for a mode, the **smallest** such element is taken.

	- The **weight** is defined as `mode * frequency(mode)`.

Return the **sum** of the weights of all **subarrays** of length `k`.

**Note:**

	- A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

	- The **frequency** of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in the array.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

Subarrays of length `k = 3` are:



			Subarray
			Frequencies
			Mode
			Mode

			​​​​​​​Frequency
			Weight




			[1, 2, 2]
			1: 1, 2: 2
			2
			2
			2 × 2 = 4


			[2, 2, 3]
			2: 2, 3: 1
			2
			2
			2 × 2 = 4



Thus, the sum of weights is `4 + 4 = 8`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,1,2], k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Subarrays of length `k = 2` are:



			Subarray
			Frequencies
			Mode
			Mode

			Frequency
			Weight




			[1, 2]
			1: 1, 2: 1
			1
			1
			1 × 1 = 1


			[2, 1]
			2: 1, 1: 1
			1
			1
			1 × 1 = 1


			[1, 2]
			1: 1, 2: 1
			1
			1
			1 × 1 = 1



Thus, the sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,3,4,3], k = 3

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:**

Subarrays of length `k = 3` are:



			Subarray
			Frequencies
			Mode
			Mode

			Frequency
			Weight




			[4, 3, 4]
			4: 2, 3: 1
			4
			2
			2 × 4 = 8


			[3, 4, 3]
			3: 2, 4: 1
			3
			2
			2 × 3 = 6



Thus, the sum of weights is `8 + 6 = 14`.



**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

### Hints

1. Use a sliding window.
2. Maintain the max frequency of the current window of length `k` using a data structure.
3. Maintain another data structure for values that have a given frequency.
