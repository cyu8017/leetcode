## Problem

There are `n` hens and `m` grains on a line. You are given the initial positions of the hens and the grains in two integer arrays `hens` and `grains` of size `n` and `m` respectively.

Any hen can eat a grain if they are on the same position. The time taken for this is negligible. One hen can also eat multiple grains.

In `1` second, a hen can move right or left by `1` unit. The hens can move simultaneously and independently of each other.

Return *the **minimum** time to eat all grains if the hens act optimally.*



**Example 1:**

**Input:** hens = [3,6,7], grains = [2,4,7,9]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
One of the ways hens eat all grains in 2 seconds is described below:
- The first hen eats the grain at position 2 in 1 second.
- The second hen eats the grain at position 4 in 2 seconds.
- The third hen eats the grains at positions 7 and 9 in 2 seconds.
So, the maximum time needed is 2.
It can be proven that the hens cannot eat all grains before 2 seconds.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** hens = [4,6,109,111,213,215], grains = [5,110,214]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
One of the ways hens eat all grains in 1 second is described below:
- The first hen eats the grain at position 5 in 1 second.
- The fourth hen eats the grain at position 110 in 1 second.
- The sixth hen eats the grain at position 214 in 1 second.
- The other hens do not move.
So, the maximum time needed is 1.



**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= hens.length, grains.length <= 2*10^{4}`

	- `0 <= hens[i], grains[j] <= 10^{9}`

### Hints

1. Binary search the answer.
2. To check if an answer is possible, for the ith hen check how far right it can go after ensuring that it eats the leftmost uneaten grain.
3. If the last grain is eaten in this process, the answer is possible.
