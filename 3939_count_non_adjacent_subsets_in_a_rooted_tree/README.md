## Problem

You are given a rooted tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, represented by an integer array parent of length n, where:

parent[0] = -1 (node 0 is the root).

	For each 1 , parent[i] is the parent of node i (0 ).

You are also given an integer array nums of length n, where `nums[i]` is the value of node i, and an integer k.

A non-empty subset of nodes is called **valid** if:

The **sum** of the values of the selected nodes is **divisible** by k.

	No **two** selected nodes are **adjacent** in the tree (no node and its direct parent are both included in the subset).

Return the number of valid subsets modulo `10^{9} + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** parent = [-1,0,1], nums = [1,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

**​​​​​​​**

The only valid subset is `{2}`. It contains node 2 with value 3, which is divisible by 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** parent = [-1,0,0,0], nums = [2,1,2,1], k = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

**​​​​​​​**​​​​​​​

The valid subsets are:

- `{1, 2}`: Nodes 1 and 2 are both children of node 0 and not directly connected to each other. Their values sum to `1 + 2 = 3`, which is divisible by 3.

	- `{2, 3}`: Nodes 2 and 3 are also non-adjacent. Their values sum to `2 + 1 = 3`, which is divisible by 3.

No other subset satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Constraints:**

n == parent.length == nums.length

	1

	parent[0] == -1

	For all 1 :

0





	1

	1 ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

	parent describes a valid rooted tree.

### Hints

1. Use tree DP. Let `dp0[u][r]` mean node `u` is not selected, and `dp1[u][r]` mean node `u` is selected, with subtree sum modulo `k` equal to `r`.
2. Initialize `dp0[u][0] = 1` and `dp1[u][nums[u] % k] = 1`.
When merging child `v`: if `u` is selected, merge only with `dp0[v]`; otherwise merge with `dp0[v] + dp1[v]`.
3. Finally return `dp0[0][0] + dp1[0][0] - 1`, subtracting the empty subset.
