## Problem

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_{i}` and `v_{i}`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either **1** or **2**.

The **cost** of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}]`, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges **in the path** such that the cost of the path between `u_{i}` and `v_{i}` is **odd**.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply **modulo** `10^{9} + 7` to each `answer[i]`.

**Note:** For each query, disregard all edges **not** in the path between node `u_{i}` and `v_{i}`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]

**Output:** [0,1]

**Explanation:**

- Query `[1,1]`: The path from Node 1 to itself consists of no edges, so the cost is 0. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 0.

	- Query `[1,2]`: The path from Node 1 to Node 2 consists of one edge (`1 → 2`). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], queries = [[1,4],[3,4],[2,5]]

**Output:** [2,1,4]

**Explanation:**

- Query `[1,4]`: The path from Node 1 to Node 4 consists of two edges (`1 → 3` and `3 → 4`). Assigning weights (1,2) or (2,1) results in an odd cost. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 2.

	- Query `[3,4]`: The path from Node 3 to Node 4 consists of one edge (`3 → 4`). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.

	- Query `[2,5]`: The path from Node 2 to Node 5 consists of three edges (`2 → 1, 1 → 3`, and `3 → 5`). Assigning (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), or (1,1,1) makes the cost odd. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 4.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10^{5}`

	- `edges.length == n - 1`

	- `edges[i] == [u_{i}, v_{i}]`

	- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `queries[i] == [u_{i}, v_{i}]`

	- `1 <= u_{i}, v_{i} <= n`

	- `edges` represents a valid tree.

### Hints

1. Dynamic programming with states `chainLength` and `sumParity`.
2. Use Lowest Common Ancestor to find the distance between any two nodes quickly in `O(logn)`.
