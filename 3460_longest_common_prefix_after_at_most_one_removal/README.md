## Problem

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

Return the **length** of the **longest common prefix** between `s` and `t` after removing **at most** one character from `s`.

**Note:** `s` can be left without any removal.



**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "madxa", t = "madam"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Removing `s[3]` from `s` results in `"mada"`, which has a longest common prefix of length 4 with `t`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode", t = "eetcode"

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

Removing `s[0]` from `s` results in `"eetcode"`, which matches `t`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "one", t = "one"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

No removal is needed.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "b"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

`s` and `t` cannot have a common prefix.



**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `1 <= t.length <= 10^{5}`

	- `s` and `t` contain only lowercase English letters.
